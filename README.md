# NIRVANA

A new Flutter project.
## what is NIRVANA
It is a social media platform where users can connect each other based on their hobbies and interests.

## what are we
The importance of mental and physical wellness is equal. We are here to propose and put into practise an idea that can significantly contribute to obtaining good mental health in our society because the digital age makes everything simple. There are many social media platforms available today, but PIXELATE is developing a new one that will allow users to interact based on shared interests, create communities, and host discussions about issues that are important to society. People can test out additional elements like drawings and other requirements on our social app. Being indulged in a hobby can be an escape for a stressed mind, and the app was developed with a motive to promote such hobbies and activities. It helps its users find activities that they find relief in and guides them throughout, from beginner-friendly tutorials to finding themselves a community to grow their hobbies.
