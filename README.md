## what is NIRVANA
It is a social media platform where users can connect each other based on their hobbies and interests.

## what are we
The importance of mental and physical wellness is equal. We are here to propose and put into practise an idea that can significantly contribute to obtaining good mental health in our society because the digital age makes everything simple. There are many social media platforms available today, but PIXELATE is developing a new one that will allow users to interact based on shared interests, create communities, and host discussions about issues that are important to society. People can test out additional elements like drawings and other requirements on our social app. Being indulged in a hobby can be an escape for a stressed mind, and the app was developed with a motive to promote such hobbies and activities. It helps its users find activities that they find relief in and guides them throughout, from beginner-friendly tutorials to finding themselves a community to grow their hobbies.

### What we have done in our project(first phase submission)
- firstly we have done a ui for social media app
- the splash screen(opening page) contains motivational quotes to make users feel relaxed because we are focusing on mental happiness and words of affirmation
- Then it redirects to a sign up page and we have connected it with firebase 
- If the user have not signed up yet, then the user can sign up with email and password
- If user have registered then user can sign in using registered mail id and password
- Then after sign up users are redirected to a profile page where users can create their profile and after creating, users can also edit their profile if needed
- We have added menu bar at the bottom it have home(profile),settings,discussions,more,tutorials pages 
- only discussion page ui have done
- In discussions page we have two options for the user 
    - Host a discussion
    - Join in a discussion
- In hosting user can create their own topic and can post it
- In joining a discussion we have a list of topics and user can choose any one of them
- Only flutter ui done for this 
- firebase connected to user authentication 

#### How far we are expected to go
- profile creation is just ui and needed backend connection
- discussion also needed backend connection
- other 3 pages in bottom menu bar do not have ui and backend 

#### Problems we have encountered
- problem with firebase connection it took almost one day due to bugs 
- dealing with flutter 
- complexity of flutter
